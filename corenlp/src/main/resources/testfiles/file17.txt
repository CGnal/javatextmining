Have you noticed Louisville is looking more international these days? Numbers appear to bear this out. Foreign-born residents of Louisville have increased from about 24,000 in 2000 to 57,000 in 2014. That same year, foreign-born persons represented 8 percent of the Louisville Metro population. Catholic Charities’ greatest amount of resources goes to immigrant services, specifically refugees. A refugee is an individual who has left his or her native country and is unable to return because of persecution or fear of death because of race, religion or political opinions. Most refugees welcomed into the U.S. have spent many years in camps in countries neighboring their homelands. The majority desire to return home but they are compelled to seek entry into a nation that will welcome them. Before their arrival, refugees have legal status, allowing entry into the U.S. and including security clearance from the FBI. For purposes of employment, clients have an I-94 (documentation of refugee status) and Social Security card. The staff provides comprehensive services, assisting refugees in transitioning into a new life. The goal is early self-sufficiency and most clients become gainfully employed within four months of arrival. Each year, Catholic Charities Employment Services matches approximately 500 refugees into jobs. Applicants and employers are assisted throughout the hiring process. Clients have obtained entry-level jobs in city government, the public school system, factories, hotels, restaurants, retail stores and many other places of employment. In recent years, Catholic Charities has developed and used social enterprise models. A social enterprise initiative integrates an agency's social mission with the market-driven approach to a business. Using social enterprise with immigrant populations, we have found a new focus for working with low-income native populations as well. Over 15 years ago we started our first social enterprise before actually knowing what it was. To trim costs, we modified our language interpretation services by training and certifying professional interpreters and scheduled them as needed. Today, services are provided throughout the community in multiple settings. The business pays for itself, provides income for other agency services, and most importantly, provides enhanced income for the interpreters. For several years, Catholic Charities received a federal grant from the Refugee Agricultural Partnership Program. When the grant ended, we decided to use a social enterprise model to focus on healthy food and nutrition as a support for family economic security. Currently Common Earth, the urban agriculture initiative, has a total of 9.25 acres across  eight community gardens, open to both community residents and refugees for their agricultural needs. Expanding the idea further, Common Table is a social enterprise focused on empowerment. This culinary arts program is designed to train refugees, former inmates, and other Louisville residents. Catering and counter lunches served twice a week help to support the program. Participants learn basic kitchen and food safety skills, during 160 food training hours over eight weeks, and receive ServSafe certification upon completion. In addition, time management skills, resume writing tips and job placement assistance are provided. Whenever possible produce used in the kitchen is grown by refugees on the Incubator Farm. The goal of all of these initiatives is to engage low-income families, whether immigrant or native, into fuller participation in the economic life of the community. Steven E.
