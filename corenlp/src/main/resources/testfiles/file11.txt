Barclaycard has collaborated with retail fashion chain TopShop to develop a range of wearable accessories incorporating its bPay contactless technology. The TOPSHOP x bPay collection includes wristbands, smartphone cases, stickers - which can be put on accessories or gadgets - and key chains, all created to discreetly hold the small bPay contactless chip. The chip links to a secure digital wallet, enabling customers to shop with a tap at 300,000 locations across the UK. Users can add funds to their digital wallet on-the-go using a mobile app, online through the bPay web portal, or via an automatic top-up which adds funds when their balance falls below a pre-set level. Earlier this year Scottish knitwear brand Lyle & Scott introduced a Â£150 'contactless jacket' that comes complete with a buttoned-down pouch for Barclays' BPay wristbands. The deal with TopShop - which has stores in every major UK city - propels Barclays bPay tech firmly into the mainstream of the high street shopping experience. Tami Hargreaves, commercial director, digital consumer payments at Barclaycard says:  The collaboration shows how the worlds of fashion and technology can combine to create a stylish and easy new way for people to pay using contactless.
