U.S. Capital Advisors LLC has hired three former Amegy Bank employees to join the firm's wealth management division, according to a Feb. 9 announcement. Joseph Klein, Stephen Hines and Doug Masterson will join the Houston-based firm as managing directors. The team has been together for more than 14 years and previously worked for JPMorgan, as well. At Amegy, they managed more than $1 billion in assets, according to the statement from USCA. We are very excited about the addition of Doug, Steve and Joe to US Capital,  Patrick Mendenhall, managing partner and head of wealth management for USCA, said in the statement.  Their impressive knowledge, depth of experience and breadth of relationships are an excellent fit for their clients and our firm. Klein, Hines and Masterson will be based in USCA's new offices in the River Oaks District. The firm signed a lease at the mixed-use center in early 2015 and will occupy the top one-and-a-half floors of a commercial building in the development. That same year, USCA announced plans to expand into the Texas Medical Center. Amegy Bank is the fifth-largest bank in the Houston area, based on its local deposits of $9.85 billion as of June 2015. It is also the 11th-largest employer downtown, according to HBJ research.
