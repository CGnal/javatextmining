WoraPay launches its universal remote mobile payments platform to a series of retail establishments in central London this month. In just over a week workers have saved a precious 10 hours of queuing time.   On average a Londoner spends about 12 minutes a day queuing for drinks and their lunchtime food. Our goal is to give this valuable time back to the consumer, time that can be spent more productively than standing in a queue,  says Vaidas Adomauskas, co-founder and CEO of WoraPay.  Consumers are able to order and pay at participating merchants using their mobile phone. Once the payment is made, the consumer receives an SMS informing them that their order is ready, allowing them to avoid costly and time consuming queues.   The huge differentiation factor from other pre-ordering solutions in the market is that the WoraPay platform integrates with existing mobile wallets - mobile apps that connect users mobile phones with their money and allow them to make payments with the phone. WioPay (debit and credit card payments) and SpectroCoin (Bitcoin payments) mobile wallets are available during the launch to select from (www.pickmobilewallet.com). Other mobile wallets, including banking apps, are currently being integrated to the platform to launch later.  WoraPay’s solution also saves Merchants’ time, since completing a remote order is up to 2.4 times faster than a live order. This gives their staff extra time to handle more clients especially at peak times, and increases sales. Moreover, with a single easy setup they can accept remote mobile payments from any connected mobile wallet.   WoraPay’s launch in the UK is supported by its involvement in Startupbootcamp FinTech London’s 2015 accelerator programme and its partners.   WoraPay serves as a great example of the innovation that is being developed by start-ups in the FinTech space, and the value of programs like Startupbootcamp to enable corporates like MasterCard to directly mentor these teams  says Stephane Wyper, Global Lead of MasterCard Start Path.    Lloyds Banking Group has been the first partner of Startupbootcamp Fintech. The accelerator programme is a great example of collaboration between startups and banks where we can provide mentorship though our banking subject matter experts to help innovative start-ups develop and grow. says Claire Calmejane, Director of Innovation at Lloyds Banking Group.
