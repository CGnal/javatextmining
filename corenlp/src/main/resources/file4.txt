In the last decade, there were a bunch of really successful fintech companies that started in Europe. Companies like Klarna, Adyen or Transferwise (to name just a few) changed the way we do payments or the way we transfer money overseas. By pursuing radical new concepts, these fintech startups became some of Europe’s most valuable companies within just a few years. The financial technology sector is hot, the summer heat is on, so let’s look at Europe’s hottest fintech startups in 2015.

And here is our list of Europe’s hottest fintech startups in 2015: Azimo: Founded in 2012 and headquartered in London, Azimo was created out of the founders frustration with the money transfer industry.
